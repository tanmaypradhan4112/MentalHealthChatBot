It's a feeling of fear or apprehension about what's to come. The first day of school, going to a job interview, or giving a speech may cause most people to feel fearful and nervous. We all get anxious sometimes, but anxiety becomes a problem when it starts affecting your daily life drastically. The best thing that you can do to help reduce anxiety is to take a few deep breaths and talk to someone about what you're feeling. Some natural remedies that you can try include: getting enough sleep meditating, staying active and exercising, eating a healthy diet, staying active and working out, avoiding alcohol, avoiding caffeine, and quitting smoking cigarettes. Support your friends and loved ones by checking up on them and just listening. Whatever you're feeling is valid."

Also called major depressive disorder or clinical depression, it affects how you feel, think and behave and can lead to a variety of emotional and physical problems. You may have trouble doing normal day-to-day activities, and sometimes you may feel as if life isn't worth living. All of us experience sadness and periods of time where things aren't that great. However, the difference in sadness and depression lies in the duration and magnitude of the problem. The best recommended course of treatment is to talk a therapist or psychiatrist who can help you find the best path for you. Everyone is different and what might work for one person might not work for another one.
